text = "In the futuristic city of NovaPoint, speed is everything. The city is powered by a mysterious energy source known as the Velocity Vortex, a swirling core of pure kinetic energy. However, the Vortex is unstable and needs constant maintenance to prevent it from collapsing and plunging the city into chaos. 

You play as Dash, a young and agile courier who loves speed. Dash is recruited by the cityâ€™s top scientists to embark on a high-speed mission through the various districts of NovaPoint. Your goal is to collect energy shards scattered across the city to stabilize the Velocity Vortex. "
